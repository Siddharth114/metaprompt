The impact of climate change further exacerbates these issues, putting additional pressure on ecosystems and biodiversity [Source 3]. Moreover, the lack of effective policies and investments for sustainable forest management and conservation hampers efforts to counteract deforestation [Source 2]. Lastly, the presence of intermediaries in the timber industry complicates the economic landscape, as most financial benefits are captured by these intermediaries rather than being fairly distributed among local producers [Source 5]."
