Initial Client Review**  \\nBefore commencing the full translation process for projects intended for distribution, a review of selected sample text by [**insert CLIENT NAME here**] can be conducted. This allows us to refine the style and tone to accurately convey your message.\\n\\n**4. Production**  \\n- **Text Translation:**  \\nThis phase involves creating a translation from the source language to the target language that is suitable for the intended audience. Our objective is not merely to translate literally but to ensure that the original nuances and tone are preserved, conveying the original message without compromise.\\n\\n- **Proofreading:**  \\nWe maintain a consistently high level of quality by thoroughly proofreading the translated text. This task is performed by an experienced native speaker of the target language who possesses expertise in the specific subject matter.\\n\\n- **Adjustment for Language Characteristics:**  \\nDuring production, we examine the stylistic layout of the translated text, aiming to minimize changes in graphical elements or text sections. For instance, translating English text into French, Spanish, or Portuguese typically results in a 20\u201325% increase in word count, which can affect the design and layout of the final product.\\n\\n- **Cultural Consulting:**  \\nUpon request, we consider the potential cultural impact of color schemes, layouts, and iconography within the target culture.

We review the overall cohesion of the project.\\n\\n- **Sampling:**  \\nSampling involves monitoring both the language and formatting of the project for accuracy and quality throughout all phases, from initiation to completion.\\n\\n- **Final Quality Check:**  \\nA comprehensive review of the project is conducted to ensure consistency, accuracy, and design integrity.\\n\\n**6. Assessment**  \\n- **Project Assessment:**  \\nAfter files have been transmitted to [**insert CLIENT NAME here**], a thorough review is conducted to evaluate whether goals and deadlines were met, identifying which elements of the production process were completed satisfactorily and which areas offered opportunities for improvement.\\n\\n- **Client Feedback:**  \\nWe solicit feedback from you to gain third-party insights into the overall success of the project and to ensure continuous improvement in TransPerfect\u2019s processes and operations.\\n\\n**7. Revisions and Updates**  \\n- **Monitoring:**  \\nMonitoring includes tailored processes to translate new or revised content and implement front- and back-end modifications. Through ongoing interaction with [**insert CLIENT NAME here**]\u2019s account manager, any additions or changes to the original content can be efficiently integrated into the translated versions.\\n\\n**8. Continuity of Translators**  \\nTransPerfect recognizes that continuity in personnel is crucial for long-term success. In cases where [**insert CLIENT NAME here**] consistently requires a specific language and/or subject matter, we will assemble a team of specialized linguists to handle all translation and proofreading tasks for projects submitted by [**insert CLIENT NAME here**]. This team will be carefully selected based on their linguistic skills and subject-matter expertise in the [**insert client\u2019s industry here**] field, ensuring familiarity with your organization\u2019s preferred terminology, style, and tone.\\n\\n**9.

This individual will familiarize themselves with [**insert CLIENT NAME here**]\u2019s specific terminology and language requirements, effectively communicating these needs to your dedicated linguistic team.

Data for the five-year period 2012-2016 is used to evaluate the impact of SINE on employment probability, wage rates, time until reemployment and job tenure. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest that a SINE job interview referral increases the probability of finding a job within three months of the referral, and reduces the number of months to find reemployment, the average job tenure of the next job and the reemployment wage. Subgroup analysis suggests that compared to more educated workers, SINE is more effective in helping less educated workers by increasing their probability of finding a job and reducing time until reemployment. Finally, the evidence suggests that online labor exchange is less effective than the service provided in person at SINE offices.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The_Effect_of_Job_Referrals_on_Labor_Market_Outcomes_in_Brazil.pdf"
