Initial Client Review**  \\nBefore commencing the full translation process for projects intended for distribution, a review of selected sample text by [**insert CLIENT NAME here**] can be conducted. This allows us to refine the style and tone to accurately convey your message.\\n\\n**4. Production**  \\n- **Text Translation:**  \\nThis phase involves creating a translation from the source language to the target language that is suitable for the intended audience. Our objective is not merely to translate literally but to ensure that the original nuances and tone are preserved, conveying the original message without compromise.\\n\\n- **Proofreading:**  \\nWe maintain a consistently high level of quality by thoroughly proofreading the translated text. This task is performed by an experienced native speaker of the target language who possesses expertise in the specific subject matter.\\n\\n- **Adjustment for Language Characteristics:**  \\nDuring production, we examine the stylistic layout of the translated text, aiming to minimize changes in graphical elements or text sections.

Assessment**  \\n- **Project Assessment:**  \\nAfter files have been transmitted to [**insert CLIENT NAME here**], a thorough review is conducted to evaluate whether goals and deadlines were met, identifying which elements of the production process were completed satisfactorily and which areas offered opportunities for improvement.\\n\\n- **Client Feedback:**  \\nWe solicit feedback from you to gain third-party insights into the overall success of the project and to ensure continuous improvement in TransPerfect\u2019s processes and operations.\\n\\n**7.

Through ongoing interaction with [**insert CLIENT NAME here**]\u2019s account manager, any additions or changes to the original content can be efficiently integrated into the translated versions.\\n\\n**8. Continuity of Translators**  \\nTransPerfect recognizes that continuity in personnel is crucial for long-term success. In cases where [**insert CLIENT NAME here**] consistently requires a specific language and/or subject matter, we will assemble a team of specialized linguists to handle all translation and proofreading tasks for projects submitted by [**insert CLIENT NAME here**].

Data for the five-year period 2012-2016 is used to evaluate the impact of SINE on employment probability, wage rates, time until reemployment and job tenure. Difference-in-differences estimates suggest that a SINE job interview referral increases the probability of finding a job within three months of the referral, and reduces the number of months to find reemployment, the average job tenure of the next job and the reemployment wage. Subgroup analysis suggests that compared to more educated workers, SINE is more effective in helping less educated workers by increasing their probability of finding a job and reducing time until reemployment. Finally, the evidence suggests that online labor exchange is less effective than the service provided in person at SINE offices.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The_Effect_of_Job_Referrals_on_Labor_Market_Outcomes_in_Brazil.pdf"

While market expectations foresee elevated policy rates and a return of inflation to target in the following years, output gaps in the region are expected to hover around zero. Central banks have effectively facilitated a soft landing by increasing policy rates to control inflation without inducing a recession. They have also relied on other tools to achieve their monetary and financial stability goals, such as expanding their balance sheets with an array of policies designed to inject liquidity into their economies. Most central banks started to offset that expansion in 2022 and continued to do so in 2023. Central banks have demonstrated their ability to control inflation while supporting governments during crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The recent moderation in inflation and the re-anchoring of inflation expectations underscore the importance of granting central banks the autonomy to independently conduct their monetary policies. Even though central banks may end up surprising markets with the rate at which they lower interest rates, so far they have been cautious in their approach, and it is crucial to preserve central bank independence.

Our methodology employs synthetic AI surveys, leveraging large language models to conduct expert-like assessments. This approach allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of job replacement likelihood, minimizing human bias and reducing assumptions about the mechanisms through which AI innovations could replace job tasks and skills. The index not only considers task automation, but also contextual factors such as social and ethical considerations and regulatory constraints that may affect the likelihood of replacement. Our findings indicate that the average likelihood of job replacement is estimated at 0.28 in the next year, increasing to 0.38 and 0.44 over the next five and ten years, respectively. To validate our methodology, we successfully replicate other measures of occupational exposure that rely on human expert assessments, substituting these with AI-based evaluations. The GENOE index provides valuable insights for policymakers, employers, and workers, offering a data-driven foundation for strategic workforce planning and adaptation in the face of rapid technological change.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Mirror-Mirror-on-the-Wall-Which-Jobs-Will-AI-Replace-After-All-A-New-Index-of-Occupational-Exposure.pdf"

Conversely, environmental taxes are advocated as efficient policy instruments. Nonetheless, removing subsidies and taxing energy can be politically challenging because vulnerable households rely on low energy prices. This study analyzes the impact of energy price increases on different income quintiles groups in eleven Latin American and Caribbean countries using an energy-extended input-output approach. Our results show that higher-income groups benefit more from low energy prices than low-income groups when tracing both the direct and indirect (supply chain) effects of energy price variations. Energy subsidies are a very expensive option to transfer income to poor households. Across the countries considered, using energy subsidies it would cost about $12 to transfer $1 of income to households in the poorest quintile. Recycling a small fraction of fiscal revenues from energy subsidy removal or energy taxation could be sufficient to compensate vulnerable households from the effects of price hikes. Our findings suggest that cash transfers to poor households and targeted subsidies for public transportation or food are the most effective measures to compensate households for welfare loss.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Managing-the-Distributional-Effects-of-Energy-Taxes-and-Subsidy-Removal-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean.pdf"

This paper randomly assigned loan requests of variable amounts to a balanced sample of male and female prospective borrowers who then submitted the assigned loan requests to randomly assigned loan officers in Chile. It is found that loan requests submitted by women are 14.8 percent less likely to be approved compared to otherwise equivalent loan requests submitted by men, even though official statistics show that women in Chile have higher repayment rates than men. In a corollary experiment, the paper explores whether gender discrimination is due to inaccurate statistical discrimination among loan officers, for which a treatment is implemented aimed at \u201ccorrecting\u201d loan officers\u2019 biased beliefs through the provision of actual information on the repayment performance of male and female borrowers. The treatment is found to be ineffective, suggesting taste-based discrimination. By eliciting gender preferences among loan officers, it is shown that male-female differences in approval rates are 30 to 32 percent larger among pro-male officers relative to not-pro-male peers, with most of the effect driven by male pro-male officers. Finally, a model-based test showing that gender discrimination decreases with the requested loan amount is also consistent with the taste-based hypothesis. It is estimated that 9.9 percent of expected bank profits are not capitalized due to taste-based discrimination (equivalent to annual foregone profits of US$ 13,400 per case), an inefficiency cost equal to the annual wage bill of 1,500 loan officers or 18 percent of all loan officers working in the Chilean banking system.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Bad-Taste-Gender-Discrimination-in-the-Consumer-Credit-Market.pdf"

Our results show a significant reduction in turnover: an average decrease of 18% across all schools, with an even more pronounced 30% reduction in schools offering higher incentives. Notably, the program also attracted new teachers to these higher-incentive schools. An analysis of teacher preferences similarly reveals a shift towards schools offering greater wage premiums. Furthermore, we find that schools offering high incentives experienced significant improvements in student test scores, with gains of 0.3-0.6 standard deviations in standardized assessments. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of monetary incentives in mitigating teacher turnover and improving educational outcomes, providing evidence-based guidance for policymakers developing teacher retention strategies."

In this paper, we use a unique dataset consisting of the entire universe of import shipments that entered Peru in 2019 to provide novel evidence on the role of both consumers and firms as importers, characterize the distribution and patterns of their foreign purchases, and assess how gravity forces shape their trade decisions, thus filling in this gap in the literature.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/Consumers-and-Firms-in-International-Trade.pdf"

Publicizing how people behave on average descriptive-norms nudging has emerged as a key tool for increasing the adoption of desirable behaviors. While nudging, by describing social norms, has proven effective in one-shot interventions in small samples (marginal-effect designs), nudging on an ongoing basis at the population level may not necessarily lead to higher compliance and can give rise to major challenges. We use a simple model to show that social adjustment dynamics can drive a populations behavior in unanticipated directions. We propose a general approach to estimating equilibrium behavior and apply it to a study of mask-wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our empirical findings align with the analytical approach and indicate that publicizing mask-wearing rates on an ongoing basis could have backfired, as initially high rates would have settled into substantially lower equilibrium rates of the behavior. In other words, if scaled up, positive marginal-effect designs do not necessarily translate into full compliance with the intervention.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Central-Role-of-Social-Dynamics-in-Nudging-Social-Norms-for-Collective-Health.pdf"

The SDGs are not binding commitments for countries, but they are an internationally recognized reference on the goals they are expected to achieve in the coming years. \n\nIt is important to emphasize that the estimated investments do not imply full compliance with the SDGs related to the provision of infrastructure services. In addition to the limitations that exist for the calculation of investments, which are duly explained in the document, the SDGs set out comprehensive goals that incorporate affordability, resilience and sustainability criteria that require the adoption of public policies that go beyond the investments needed to provide more and better infrastructure. \n\nIn this sense, the estimates presented in the study should be interpreted as a lower bound. This estimate can be used to calculate the additional investments needed to make infrastructure services more sustainable, which could include, among others, a much greater and faster increase in the penetration of renewable energies in the regional energy matrix, transmission lines that strengthen the regional integration of electricity systems, flood control works, water and sewerage networks that are resilient to natural disasters, as well as investments in green infrastructure to ensure water quality and quantity in the context of climate change.\n\nAccording to the calculations of this study, by 2030 Latin America and the Caribbean needs to invest US$2,220,736 million in the water and sanitation, energy, transportation and telecommunications sectors to expand and maintain the infrastructure necessary to meet the SDGs. Of this total, 59% will need to be allocated to investments for new infrastructure and 41% to investments for maintenance and replacement of assets reaching the end of their useful life. In terms of investment effort relative to the size of the economy, Latin America and the Caribbean will need to invest at least 3.12% of its GDP in infrastructure each year until 2030.\n\nIn the sectoral analysis, closing the access gap and maintaining the quality of water and sanitation services, including wastewater treatment, requires an average annual investment effort of 0.50% of regional GDP. In the electricity sector, Latin America and the Caribbean should invest 0.81% of its GDP annually to provide universal access to electricity to the entire population and to advance in the decarbonization of the electricity generation matrix in accordance with the countries' expansion programs. In the transportation sector, closing gaps in road infrastructure, airports and public transportation requires an annual investment of 1.37% of the region's GDP. Finally, in the telecommunications sector, increasing household connectivity through broadband and mobile internet technologies with 4G standard requires an average annual investment of 0.41% of GDP until 2030.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Infrastructure-Gap-in-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean-Investment-Needed-Through-2030-to-Meet-the-Sustainable-Development-Goals.pdf"

These costs include the loss of human capital due to homicides, security spending by businesses, and public spending on crime prevention. The study also reviews and summarizes recent literature on indirect costs, such as the effects on economic growth, investment, business productivity, health, and the environment. It also incorporates three additional analyses that explore the impact of crime on tourism, migration, and productivity. Taken together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the consequences of crime and violence for societies in the region.<br/><br/>URL: https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/The-Costs-of-Crime-and--and-Violence-Expansion-and-Update-of-Estimates-for-Latin-America-and-the-Caribbean.pdf"

We present evidence on the impact of this policy on multinational firms location decisions using -for the first time to our knowledge- firm-level data. To do so, we carry out difference-in-differences and instrumental variables estimations on data on the establishment and location of affiliates of multinational firms and assistance by the investment promotion agency (IPA) in Costa Rica over the period 2000-2016. Estimates suggest that investment promotion has been effective: support from the IPA is associated with an increase of 11 percentage points in the probability that a multinational firm establishes its first affiliate in the country.
